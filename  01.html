        <h1>Crying Over You (Honne)</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
        You don't mean to be a problem
        <br>You don't mean to 'cause me pain
        <br>You don't mean to do much but they're, one and the same
        </p>
        
        I don't know where this came from
        <br>I thought we were plain sailing
        <br>This has taken me aback and it, it goes without saying
        <br>That I'm gonna feel broken for a bit
        <br>Life's gonna be a little bit shit
        <br>Oh, for at least the next week
        <br>We had our flaws I'll be the first to admit
        <br>And we both struggled to commit
        <p>
        Oh, was it really that bleak?
        <br>And I don't know why I've been crying over you
        <br>For the life of me, I wish that I knew
        <br>And I don't know, just how much more I can go through
        <br>Man, oh man I wish I knew, <b><u>why I've been crying over you</u></b>
        </p>
